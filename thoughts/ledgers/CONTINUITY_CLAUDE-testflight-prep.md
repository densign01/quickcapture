## Backlog

### ✅ FIXED: Missing Article Metadata from App Shares
- When sharing from NYT app, title and publication are not extracted
- **Fix:** Share extension now fetches page and extracts og:title/twitter:title/<title>
- Commit: `64fc202`

### ✅ FIXED: Hide API Endpoint from Settings
- API Endpoint field is exposed in Settings UI (unnecessary for end users)
- **Fix:** Removed from UI, keeps hardcoded default

- Brief doesn't appear in share sheet when sharing from NYT app (works from Safari/NYT.com)
- **Fix:** Added NSExtensionActivationSupportsText and NSExtensionActivationSupportsAttachmentsWithMaxCount
- Commit: `500c662`

### ✅ FIXED: Paywall Bypass for AI Summaries  
- Paywalled content (e.g., NYT) returns "Article content was behind a paywall - no summary available"
- **Fix:** Now uses generateTitleBasedSummary() to create AI-inferred summary from title
- **Enhancement:** Summaries now labeled "AI-generated from title - full article not accessible"

### ✅ FIXED: AI Summary Not Generating (2025-12-29)

- Decodes titles from: plain text, property list, og:title, twitter:title, `<title>` tag
- Commit: pending

### ✅ FIXED: Resend Domain Verification for External Testers (2025-12-31)
- Registered `send-brief.com` domain via Cloudflare
- Verified domain with Resend
- Updated API `from` address: `onboarding@resend.dev` → `brief@send-brief.com`

- Commit: `f796cb7`

### ✅ CHANGED: "Article" to "Link" Terminology (2025-01-01)

- Realistic mocks: Safari browser, share sheet with app icons, loading spinner
- Branch: `feature/onboarding-flow` merged to main
- Commit: `b0393da`

### ✅ ADDED: Tweet Content Extraction via oEmbed (2025-12-29)
- X/Twitter shares were showing AI-generated guesses instead of actual tweet text
- **Fix:** Added `fetchTweetContent()` using Twitter's free oEmbed API
- Extracts: author name, handle, actual tweet text
- Display: Tweet styled with Twitter-blue left border, proper attribution
- Skips AI summary for tweets (actual content is better)
- Detection now runs unconditionally (not just when title is missing)
- Deployed to Cloudflare Workers

### Feature: Links Sent History
- Add ability to see previously sent links
- Track what articles have been captured
- Would require backend storage or local persistence
- Consider sync across devices

### Exploration: Infrastructure Evaluation
- Evaluate alternatives to current Cloudflare Workers + Resend setup
- Firebase could provide:
  - Authentication
  - Firestore for history/sync
  - Cloud Functions for API
  - Push notifications
- Compare cost, complexity, and feature tradeoffs
