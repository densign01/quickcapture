### Phase 11: Accessibility Contrast Fix [COMPLETE - 2026-01-20]
**Issue:** Apple rejected app for "hard to read type or typography" on iPad

- Replaced all `.foregroundColor(.secondary)` with `.foregroundColor(.briefSecondaryText)`
- Fixed disabled/loading button text: conditional gray instead of white

**Files Modified:**
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| ContentView.swift | 9 secondary colors + disabled button |
| ShareView.swift | 3 secondary colors + loading button |
| OnboardingView.swift | 1 secondary color |

- Platform-specific: iOS uses swipe TabView, macOS uses button navigation
- Realistic mocks: Safari browser, share sheet with app icons, loading spinner
- Branch: `feature/onboarding-flow` merged to main
- Commit: `b0393da`

### ✅ ADDED: Tweet Content Extraction via oEmbed (2025-12-29)
- X/Twitter shares were showing AI-generated guesses instead of actual tweet text
- **Fix:** Added `fetchTweetContent()` using Twitter's free oEmbed API

### Exploration: Infrastructure Evaluation
- Evaluate alternatives to current Cloudflare Workers + Resend setup
- Firebase could provide:
  - Authentication
  - Firestore for history/sync
  - Cloud Functions for API
  - Push notifications
- Compare cost, complexity, and feature tradeoffs
