# Continuity Ledger: Brief TestFlight Prep

- **Subtitle:** Send links to your inbox
- **Keywords:** read later,save articles,email,summary,AI,bookmark,links,share extension
- **Description:**
  > Brief makes it easy to save articles, links, and posts for later — delivered straight to your email.
  >
  > Share any link from Safari, X, LinkedIn, Instagram, or any app. Brief sends it to your inbox with an AI-generated summary so you can decide what's worth reading.
  >
  > **How it works:**
  > 1. Tap Share on any link
  > 2. Select Brief
  > 3. Get an email with the link and summary
  >
  > No account needed. Just enter your email once and start saving.

**Checklist:**

## Open Questions
- [x] Are bundle IDs registered in Apple Developer portal? YES
- [x] Is there a privacy policy URL for App Store Connect? YES → `https://densign01.github.io/quickcapture/privacy.html`
- [x] Register `send-brief.com` via Cloudflare → verify with Resend → update API from address

## Backlog

### ✅ FIXED: Missing Article Metadata from App Shares
- When sharing from NYT app, title and publication are not extracted
- **Fix:** Share extension now fetches page and extracts og:title/twitter:title/<title>
- Commit: `64fc202`

### ✅ FIXED: Paywall Bypass for AI Summaries  
- Paywalled content (e.g., NYT) returns "Article content was behind a paywall - no summary available"

  - API fix: Added `decodeHTMLEntities()` on Cloudflare side - `26d366a`

  - Fix: Strip `\n` from subject line on API - `e451141`
- Applied to both iOS/macOS extensions and Cloudflare Workers

### ✅ FIXED: Product Pages Showing "Shared Link" (2026-01-02)
- Non-article links (e-commerce, product pages) showed generic "Shared Link" title
- Root cause: App sent "Shared Link" fallback, blocking API from extracting real title

- Applied to both iOS and macOS share extensions
- Commit: `44e768d`

### ✅ CHANGED: "Article" to "Link" Terminology (2025-01-01)

- Step 1: Email entry with validation (saves to UserPreferences)
- Step 2: Enable extension instructions with setup guide link
- Step 3: Animated share demo showing Safari → Share → Brief → Email
- Platform-specific: iOS uses swipe TabView, macOS uses button navigation
- Realistic mocks: Safari browser, share sheet with app icons, loading spinner
- Branch: `feature/onboarding-flow` merged to main
- Commit: `b0393da`

### ✅ ADDED: Tweet Content Extraction via oEmbed (2025-12-29)
- X/Twitter shares were showing AI-generated guesses instead of actual tweet text
- **Fix:** Added `fetchTweetContent()` using Twitter's free oEmbed API
- Extracts: author name, handle, actual tweet text
- Display: Tweet styled with Twitter-blue left border, proper attribution
- Skips AI summary for tweets (actual content is better)
- Detection now runs unconditionally (not just when title is missing)
- Deployed to Cloudflare Workers

### Feature: Links Sent History
- Add ability to see previously sent links
- Track what articles have been captured
- Would require backend storage or local persistence
- Consider sync across devices

### Exploration: Infrastructure Evaluation
- Evaluate alternatives to current Cloudflare Workers + Resend setup
- Firebase could provide:
  - Authentication
  - Firestore for history/sync
  - Cloud Functions for API
  - Push notifications
- Compare cost, complexity, and feature tradeoffs
