# Continuity Ledger: Brief TestFlight Prep

## Goal
Streamline the Brief project and prepare iOS/macOS app for TestFlight submission.

## Constraints
- Keep only: `Brief/` (iOS+macOS app), `brief-api/`, `brief-web/`
- Delete: `brief-raycast/`, `brief-extension/`, `brief-macos/` (superseded)

## Key Decisions
- Using unified `Brief/` Xcode project for both iOS and macOS
- Share Extension architecture (not Safari Web Extension)
- App Group: `group.com.danielensign.Brief`
- Bundle ID: `com.danielensign.Brief`
- Deployment targets: iOS 17.0, macOS 14.0
- UI Theme: Purple/indigo gradient (#6346E0 → #9355E9)

## Working Set

- `Brief/Shared (App)/ContentView.swift` - Main app UI
- `Brief/Shared (Extension)/ShareView.swift` - Share extension UI
- `brief-api/src/index.js` - Cloudflare Workers API

## Backlog

### ✅ FIXED: Missing Article Metadata from App Shares
- When sharing from NYT app, title and publication are not extracted
- **Fix:** Share extension now fetches page and extracts og:title/twitter:title/<title>
- Commit: `64fc202`

### ✅ FIXED: Hide API Endpoint from Settings
- API Endpoint field is exposed in Settings UI (unnecessary for end users)
- **Fix:** Removed from UI, keeps hardcoded default
- Commit: `64fc202`

### ✅ FIXED: Brief Not Visible in Share Sheet from Certain Apps
- Brief doesn't appear in share sheet when sharing from NYT app (works from Safari/NYT.com)
- **Fix:** Added NSExtensionActivationSupportsText and NSExtensionActivationSupportsAttachmentsWithMaxCount
- Commit: `500c662`

### ✅ FIXED: Paywall Bypass for AI Summaries  
- Paywalled content (e.g., NYT) returns "Article content was behind a paywall - no summary available"
- **Fix:** Now uses generateTitleBasedSummary() to create AI-inferred summary from title
- **Enhancement:** Summaries now labeled "AI-generated from title - full article not accessible"
- Deployed to Cloudflare Workers
- Commit: `500c662`, `b226e67`

### ✅ FIXED: New App Icon Design
- Created purple/indigo gradient icon with document + AI sparkle
- Matches new UI theme
- All sizes generated (16-1024px)
- Commit: `8fa2eb7`

### ✅ FIXED: UI Cleanup
- Complete redesign with purple/indigo theme
- Card-based layout with shadows
- Gradient accent buttons
- Better section organization with labels and icons
- Setup prompt for new users
- Polished settings view
- Commit: `b226e67`

### ✅ FIXED: X.com/Twitter URL Titles
- X/Twitter returned "JavaScript is not available" as title
- **Fix:** Extract @username from URL, display as "Post by @username on X"
- Filter out other bad titles from JS-heavy sites
- Commit: `b226e67`

### ✅ FIXED: macOS Safari Share Extension URL Not Extracted
- Share extension was sending empty URL from Safari
- **Fix:** Added multiple fallback extraction methods (userInfo, attributedContentText, fileURL type)
- Commit: `2f0388a`

### ✅ ADDED: Keyboard Shortcuts for macOS
- ⌘+Return to send
- Escape to cancel
- Hint text showing keyboard shortcut
- Commit: `1faa623`

### ✅ SWITCHED: AI Provider to Gemini 2.5 Flash (2024-12-28)
- Migrated from OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Updated `@ai-sdk/openai` → `@ai-sdk/google` in package.json
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Pricing: $0.30/1M input, $2.50/1M output
- Added `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to Cloudflare secrets
- Can remove `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from Cloudflare

### Feature: Links Sent History
- Add ability to see previously sent links
- Track what articles have been captured
- Would require backend storage or local persistence
- Consider sync across devices

### Exploration: Infrastructure Evaluation
- Evaluate alternatives to current Cloudflare Workers + Resend setup
- Firebase could provide:
  - Authentication
  - Firestore for history/sync
  - Cloud Functions for API
  - Push notifications
- Compare cost, complexity, and feature tradeoffs
